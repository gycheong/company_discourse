# erdos-companydiscourse
There is a wealth of discourse on companies and their products on social media platforms and online forums. While many approaches leverage analytical techniques to gauge audience sentiment through online discourse, they lack the ability to be both targeted and customizable while maintaining complex analytical integrity.

## Project Description 
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to construct predictive models capable of assessing and rating comments provided by consumers for a **target company**. In this project we used [Costco](https://www.costco.com/) as the target company. By employing these advanced analytical methods, we aim to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment analysis in understanding and forecasting consumer behavior. **To view a detailed description of the entire project for Costco as the target company **, please run the [full notebook](https://github.com/dhk628/erdos-companydiscourse/blob/main/final%20notebook.ipynb)
