    "### **Finding Numerical Ratings of Consumer Sentiments using GTE Sentence Transformers**\n",
    "\n",
    "by Vinicius Ambrosi, Gilyoung Cheong, Dohoon Kim, Hannah Lloyd\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract**. There is a wealth of discourse on companies and their products on social media platforms and online forums. While many approaches leverage analytical techniques to gauge audience sentiment through online discourse, they lack the ability to be both targeted and customizable while maintaining complex analytical integrity. In this report, we use Sentence Transformers, a state-of-art text embedding API, with GTE (General Text Embeddings with Multi-stage Contrastive Learning) pre-trained model, to vectorize 788,766 comments from Google Reviews into 1024-dimensional vectors. We then use these vectors as features to train our models and develop rating models that rate a given comment from 1 to 5 stars. Each vector provides 1024 features for a review comment, with the target variable being the rating. We develope our models using logistic regression (one vs. rest), k-nearest neighbor, suppor vector machine, XGBoost, and neural networks with a simple architecture after appropriate train-test splits. To address the biased nature of the training data, which favors 4 or 5-star ratings, we also build our model with random under-sampling. With or without under-sampling, we significantly improve the baseline model, which always predicts 5 stars. Our experiemental results provide how to use pre-trained Sentence Transformers to extract numerical values of consumer sentiments from online comments without the extra cost of pre-training. To corroborate our results, we demonstrate that our best-performing model performs well in predicting the ratings of reviews for the same business from a website other than Google Reviews."

    "Online comments and reviews have grown increasingly vital in shaping consumer decisions, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous studies, including [[1]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865702/full), [[3]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-5443-6_1), [[8]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8970492), [[9]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563210000907), [[10]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8631160), and [[11]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567422320300570), have underscored the significance of analyzing consumer sentiments within the realms of e-commerce and tourism. The importance of these sentiments has been highlighted, showing that understanding consumer feedback can provide valuable insights into market trends and customer preferences. In light of these findings, this report utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to construct predictive models capable of assessing and rating comments provided by consumers. By employing these advanced analytical methods, we aim to enhance the correctness and effectiveness of sentiment analysis in understanding and forecasting consumer behavior."

    "**1.1. NLP Methodology: GTE Sentence Transformers**. We use Sentence Transformers, a state-of-the-art text embedding NLP, to vectorize 788,766 pre-processed comments from Google Reviews about a specific business (Costco). These vectors then serve as input features for building predictive models for ratings. The pre-trained model for our sentence transformer is GTE (General Text Embeddings with Multi-stage Contrastive Learning) developed by Alibaba Group NLP team in [[5]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03281). The earliest Sentence Transfomer, called \"Sentence-BERT,\" was developed in [[6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) by Reimers and Gurebych and is based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), introduced in [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) by Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT was revolutionary because it provided vector representations of sentences, with each subword token encoded into a vector that retains its relationship with the entire input context. This contextual awareness enabled BERT to excel in tasks such as question answering, where it generates answers based on user-provided context. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, using BERT for sentence clustering posed challenges because it required providing the full context every time a sentence was vectorized. This limitation made BERT less suitable for building predictive models that needed to be tested on unknown data. Additionally, since BERT encodes each subword of a sentence into a vector, a sentence corresponds to a sequence of vectors, not a single vector, which requires significant storage. Various attempts to address these issues involved encoding each sentence without context and using either the encoded vector of the first special token (called the [CLS] token) or the average vector of the sequence of encoded vectors of all the subwords, but these approaches generally led to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence Transformers uses specific loss functions to train the average BERT-generated vector of subwords of each sentence in the training set so that two semantically similar sentences are associated with two vectors that are close to each other in terms of (Euclidean) distance and angle, the latter of which is measured by cosine similarity. The details of the pre-training and fine-tuning processes of GTE Sentence Transformers are available in Section 3 of [[5]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03281)."

    "**1.2. ML Methodology: Logistic Regression, kNN, XGBoost, and FNN**. We use several widely accessible machine learning (ML) models to train on the vectors we get from GTE Sentence Transformers on our data so that they can rate a given online comment from 1 to 5 stars to capture consumers' sentiments. Specifically, we use logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), suppor vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FNN) with three hidden layers and ReLU activation to build our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3. Data and Variables**. We use [2021 Google Review data](https://datarepo.eng.ucsd.edu/mcauley_group/gdrive/googlelocal/) collected by Li and Zhang for their papers [[4]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.426.pdf) and [[7]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3539618.3592036). During our pre-processing, using the Google Maps ID attached to each data point, we extracted 788,766 reviews for Costco from consumers in the United States. We use GTE Sentence Transformer to construct a unique vector for each review comment in $\\mathbb{R}^{1024}$, the 1024-dimensional real vector space. Each component of such a vector is used as an input feature for each comment, so a comment has 1024 input features. The target variable is the rating, which is an integer in $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The following is the scatter plot of our training set, which is 80% of our data, projected on the first and second principal components:\n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/PCA picture.png\" width=\"50%\"></img>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For building our models, we first separate the training set with test set with a ratio of 8:2. Within the training set, we apply a 11-fold cross validation for each ML method when we build our models. (For FFN, the 11-fold cross validation is simplified to a 10:1 train-test split.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4. Key Contribution**. Our key contribution is to showcase how the imblanced nature of our data influences various accssible ML models we use in the predictive analysis for consumer sentiments when it comes to online reviews. Focusing on the accurcy alone is misleading because our data is highly imbalanced. The following is the histogram for ratings in our testing set:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Imbalance picture.png\" width=\"50%\"></img>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each predictive modeling, we also build an additional model after random under-sampling. As the reader may expect, the overall accuracy drops, but we still get a better cross-validation and the confusion matrix is much more convincing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.5. Comparing with Preceding Works**. There are have been great interests in analyzing consumers' sentiment, many of which are surveyed by Yang, Li, Wang, and Sherratt in Section II of [[8]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8970492). In Section III of their paper, the authors also devleop their own sentiment analysis model by manually identifying (sub)words with positive and negative sentiments to create weights attached to BERT-generated vectors from the comments they pre-train. Then they apply convolutional neural network (CNN) and a modified version of recurrent neural network (RNN) to modify vectors so that they are ideally infludenced by a few words with stong sentiment and remember relationships between words. After that, they apply another linear layer with hyperbolic tangent activation followed by a SoftMax to get a numerical value between 0 and 1. Then the authors of [[8]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8970492) use a real-world data set (in Chinese) with rating to compare their model with the true rating. Their classification is binary by classifying 1 and 2 starts to be positive while 3, 4, and 5 stars to be negative. On the other hand, our approach is greatly simplified thanks to Sentence Transformers, which cuts the pre-training step, and this can be a significant reduction in cost for deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [[3]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-5443-6_1), Kim, Lee, Lim, Kim, and Hong also used Senternce Transformers to rank the top tourist spots in Busan, South Korea, by measuring cosine similairties between a vector generated by a given query sentence (e.g., \"It is a beautiful beach\") to the vectors generated from online review comments. Two major differences are that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kim et al used the model [\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for the sentence transformer, while we use GTE: [\"thenlper/gte-large\"](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large);\n",
    "2. the input features for Kim et al are generated by the cosine similarities between the comment vectors and a given query vector, while we directly use components of the comment vectors as our input features so that no information is possibly lost after vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either work above, the issue for the imbalance in data is not addressed. Overall, dealing with the imbalanced issue with consumer sentiment analysis is not sufficiently addressed in the literature when pertaining to consumer sentiment analysis, despite it being a common issue in data science. This was a major motivation for our investigation."
